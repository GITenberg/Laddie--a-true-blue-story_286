description: In Laddie, Little Sister tells us the story of her brother Laddie and
  her family seen through her loving eyes. She adores Laddie, and feels that he is
  the only sibling who cares about her. In her loneliness she finds comfort in the
  natural world. Largely autobiographical, Gene Stratton-Porter's novel is a classic
  tale of self-discovery.
